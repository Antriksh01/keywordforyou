            What is YouTube SEO?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400">
            YouTube SEO is used to optimize your YouTube videos and channels
            that help you to increase your channel's ranking on the YouTube
            search engine. Better optimized YouTube videos can increase matrices
            like count, brand awareness, revenue, and many more. You can improve
            the search engine ranking of your YouTube channel by optimizing its
            videos, playlists, metadata, and descriptions. Video optimization is
            possible for YouTube's search engine and other search engines. Your
            videos can be found on Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. You can optimize
            your YouTube video by looking at how many viewers it has reached and
            how well it ranks within a specific category. According to research,
            brands that optimize for YouTube search trends have seen a 50%
            increase in viewing time year-over-year. Moreover, video editors
            having SEO skills can charge more for their work. For instance,
            YouTube SEO tools like the Ytubetool offer the best toolset for
            video marketers to create search engine-friendly YouTube videos.
            Using Ytubetool, you can improve the performance of your YouTube

            What Are the Benefits of YouTube SEO?
          </h2>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #1: Connect & communicate with your audience more quickly.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You can increase your chance of people sharing your links with their
            family and friends if you are using video marketing and sharing
            quality content. You will be boosted on Google and other search
            engines once you work correctly on YouTube SEO.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #2: You can get a better engagement rate.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You can increase engagement with your website content or blog posts
            more quickly if you use video marketing. Facebook, Twitter, and
            Google+ are popular social media sites where people share the videos
            they find interesting. Your organic marketing efforts can be boosted
            quite effectively if you engage your audience in such a way. The
            only thing you need is a good strategy and some consistency.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #3: Relationship building.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You may need to create a relationship with your audience via your
            content if you're using video marketing to increase visitors to your
            site from Google and Bing. It would be best if you focused on this
            from the beginning. Of course, it takes time. Instead of trying for
            quick results from a one-time video upload, we've found it's better
            to work on building the relationship over time. If you're making
            content solely to try to “make a sale,” – you're doing it wrong.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #4: Choose the topics, and show your expertise.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You can show people your expertise by using video marketing. Your
            audience will be more likely to subscribe and return to your content
            again and again when you demonstrate this accurately. Instead of
            just visiting once after finding an article or video of yours on
            Google, they will come back again and again.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #5: Brand awareness Boost.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            People will more likely recognize your brand name if you use video
            marketing. As a result, they might be more glad to visit your
            website or blog in the future. Your company's revenue will increase
            quickly if you get this right.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #6: Boost website traffic.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            After watching your videos, people are more likely to visit your
            website if you use video marketing. You will be able to generate
            more leads and customers for your business over time and improve
            your website's SEO.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">
            #7: Stay on top of your visitors' attention.
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You should also share your videos on your website if you use video
            marketing. If your website only has text and images, your visitors
            will leave more quickly. This is your chance to show them why you're
            the right solution for their problems and to convert them into a
            lead.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-gray-600 text-md mt-2 text-justify font-bold">

          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            You will be more likely to get your audience to visit your website
            and blog posts if you use video marketing to get their attention and
            share valuable information with them. As a result, the more time
            your prospects spend with you and your content - the more
            “buyer-ready” they will be.

            5 Simple Steps To Running A Truly Useful Video Audit
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            1. Review the video goals and content as well for marketing
            strategies.
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            What is the purpose of producing video content? Why are you doing
            it? Do you have any goals or objectives in mind? How do your videos
            fit into your broader content marketing strategy, and how do those
            goals relate to your more comprehensive business strategy? You might
            want to create video content to help lead prospects down your sales
            funnel. You might use video to present at events you attend or to
            build trust with visitors to your website. Perhaps it's a mix of all
            these and more. Video can never be evaluated fairly unless you
            understand your aims for the content and future needs. Therefore,
            you need to determine what kind of video content you want. Get
            sign-off from everyone to ensure you're all on the same page about
            what you expect from your videos. After the video audit is complete,
            you will better understand what to do next, which will help you make
            meaningful and lasting changes.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            2. Get your complete video data.
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify mt-2 text-gray-400">
            This part is called the consuming part. Now you need to encounter
            all the video details and compile them into a single space. We
            recommend use our YouTube Video Audit for a simple spreadsheet
            layout.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here's the mandatory sort of data you should include in your audit:
          </p>
          <ul className="mx-3 mt-2 list-disc">
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              URL of the video asset (where it's hosted)

              Metrics like views, play rate, engagement rate, shares,
              click-through rate, and conversion rate.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Site pages the video is embedded on
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              How you use the video

            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">Aim of the video</li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">Topic/subject</li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Type of video (brand film, educational video, advert, product
              video, case study video, etc.)
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">Date of release</li>

              Keywords (If applicable)

          </ul>
          <p className="text-justify text-gray-400 mt-2 text-sm">
            You should start looking wherever you host your video content if you
            want to track it down. YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (or a combination
            of these) are some of the most popular video hosting platforms. Your
            videos can also be hosted on your server. Make sure you have posted
            any standalone videos to your social media accounts. Review any
            content you syndicate or publish. Last but not least, if your
            website has a lot of video content, it's crucial to check your site
            pages to ensure that nothing has slipped through the cracks. YTube
            Tool is the most reliable way to discover which of your pages
            contain embedded video content apart from looking through them
            manually. Create a custom filter for whichever hosting service you
            use by crawling your site with the tool.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            3. All your video content should be evaluated.
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            The data is in your hands. Data is meaningless until it is analyzed.
            Your next step is to review each video and determine whether it is
            valid and of good quality. You can do this yourself; you can ask a
            team to analyze your video content once. When assessing content,
            it's often helpful to have an extra set of eyes, especially if those
            eyes are attached to people across the different departments using
            your videos differently. Using the information you've gathered,
            review your current video content and check how it's performing in
            the real world. Also, check whether the video meets the standard
            quality and standard or not.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Consider these questions first:

              Does this video perform well?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              What is the most effective way to use this video content? What
              could we do with it?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Does it inspire you, make you think, or make you smile? Does it

            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              How do we feel about this video? Do we want to continue using it?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            4. Develop A Video Content Marketing Platform With Gaps.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-400 mt-2">
            Ask yourself the following questions after reviewing all the videos
            you've watched so far:
          </h3>
          <ul className="mx-3 mt-2 list-disc">
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Does your video content have any obvious gaps?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Did you miss out on any upcoming opportunities?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Can you identify a content gap in the market that you could fill?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              Have you been able to accomplish your goals so far with what you
              have?
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-2">
              What new types of content might be effective for reaching them?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            An audit of your video content goes beyond assessing what you have
            now. In addition, it's about thinking about ways to improve video
            content marketing in the future. Video content should be segmented
            on topics, types, products or services mentioned, buyer personas,
            and marketing funnel stages. Examine your funnel to see if any
            personas are missing content. Video content can be used to support
            different types of products/services. Your video content must cover
            all the relevant topics your audience cares about. The type of video
            content you produce at the top of the funnel, like social content or
            fun brand videos, may be abundant, but there may be a lack of
            content further down the funnel to drive sales, such as detailed
            product videos or case studies. The only educational videos
            currently available on digital marketing are poor, so you may need
            to create your own. With an effective piece of video content, you
            can beat your competition.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-md font-bold text-gray-600 mt-2">
            5. Improve Your Content Creation Strategy.
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2">
            The only thing left is deciding what to do with your existing
            content and how to improve your content marketing going forward. In
            step one, identify the goals that need to be supported by a video
            content marketing strategy. Be sure to integrate any changes you
            want to make into your overall strategy. You may have noticed that
            your blog regularly generates high engagement and conversion rates
            with educational videos. Instead of focusing on other types of
            top-of-funnel content (less effective), you switch tactics to
            include educational videos. Just make sure it's noted wherever you
            log your strategy. And, of course, then it's time to build and
            execute a specific plan for creating your new videos and updating
            your old ones. If you're working with a video agency, you can pass
            this stage on them (and the good ones might even run your entire
            video audit for you!).
